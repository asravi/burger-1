# Eat-da-Burger!

###### About this app:

This app is a burger logger that uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). It follows the MVC design pattern and uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

In the left-hand column, there is a list of burgers ready to be devoured. Once the "devour" button is clicked, these burgers get moved to the Devoured Burgers column. Users can also place an order, type in a burger name, and that burger name will get added to the "Ready-to-Eat Burgers" column, waiting to be devoured.
